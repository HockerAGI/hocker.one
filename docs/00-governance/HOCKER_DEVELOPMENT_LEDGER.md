# HOCKER Development Ledger

## Purpose

Durable continuity record for the HOCKER ecosystem. It records evidence and explicit uncertainty; it does not convert repository activity into product-completion claims.

**Supersedes operational use of PR #215** while preserving PR #215 and branch `ops/hocker-development-ledger` as immutable historical audit evidence through its final recorded cut. No historical PR or commit is deleted by this supersession.

Detailed recovery semantics are governed by `docs/operations/LAST_KNOWN_STATE.md` and `DOC_ALIGNMENT_2026-08-17-R1.md`.

## Current pointers at this evidence cut

These are mutable and must be re-queried before mutation:

- Hocker One `main`: `6b3b4f35820f4fb9c0906fa582dcd397d3169f88` after PR #228.
- Canonical counts: 10 applications / 16 AGIs.
- Connected engineering repositories: 9.
- Connected Vercel projects: 3 (`hocker-one`, `hocker.agi`, `chido-casino`).
- Primary Supabase project: `yvuibbcuntqpyqiuqggd`.
- Supabase Branching: `main=FUNCTIONS_DEPLOYED`, preview project `ACTIVE_HEALTHY` at the latest read.

## Current Hocker One closure snapshot

### Closed

- P0 provider-independent NOVA runtime and durable canonical session/message store.
- Complete Supabase migration-ledger parity (#218/#219).
- Backend-only explicit RLS intent (#220).
- `project_members` owner/admin write boundary (#221).
- recovery-pointer authority semantics and executable regression alignment (#223/#225).
- Node Mirror heartbeat-only liveness (#224), followed by real-schema hotfix (#226).
- three canonical AGI foreign-key indexes (#227), production migration `20260817052915`.
- bounded Supabase Advisor exception register (#228); intentional GraphQL/RPC warnings are no longer treated as unclassified debt.

### Core Integration Ready blockers still open

- Owner AAL2 human ceremony.
- 16/16 durable `agi_eval_result` / required `agi_tool_eval_result` evidence.
- Supabase Leaked Password Protection provider setting and verification.

See `docs/operations/PLATFORM_CLOSURE_2026-08-17.md` for the current decision boundary.

## Runtime capability status

### Hocker One / NOVA primary

Hocker One remains the primary NOVA runtime/control plane. Provider/model identity is internal telemetry; Owner Gate remains authoritative for material actions.

### Physical Node Agent

State: **DEGRADED**.

Production `public.nodes` contains `hocker-node-1` with a historical `online` value but a May 2026 `last_seen_at`. PR #224/#226 removed the false-positive mirror behavior: liveness now derives from `nodes.id + last_seen_at` with a 5-minute freshness window. The current node is therefore `sin_senal_reciente` until a real agent heartbeat arrives.

No database row was rewritten merely to manufacture an offline status.

### Dedicated `nova.agi` / Railway

State: **DEGRADED / fallback not currently certified**.

Railway was already implemented; do not reinstall it. GitHub deployment evidence created by `railway-app[bot]` shows:

- production deployment of `nova.agi` SHA `8be3cdc1891d740cc72d79e60d3aa35199b7efa2`;
- deployment status `success` on 2026-07-15;
- later deployment status **inactive** on 2026-07-29;
- no newer GitHub-linked Railway deployment in the currently returned deployment history.

This proves historical Railway deployment and an inactive latest linked record; it does not prove the whole Railway project was deleted or globally unavailable. Hocker One unified NOVA runtime remains primary.

## Supabase security state

### Closed/remediated

- prior RLS-enabled/no-policy findings for `compliance_events`, `game_history`, `wager_progress_ledger` are absent;
- migration branch drift is closed;
- command/node duplicate-permissive policy overlap was reconciled;
- three canonical AGI unindexed-FK findings were closed by migration `20260817052915`;
- production inspection of all currently reported authenticated GraphQL tables found RLS enabled with policy coverage.

### Accepted only under explicit contracts

`docs/security/SUPABASE_ADVISOR_EXCEPTION_REGISTER_2026-08-17.md` governs:

- anonymous AGI catalog/tier/promo discoverability;
- authenticated GraphQL discoverability under RLS;
- bounded SECURITY DEFINER public leaderboard/recent-wins projections;
- authenticated own-history projections.

Any new Advisor finding or weakening of those invariants reopens security review.

### Still open

- Leaked Password Protection.

## AGI evidence state

- canonical AGIs: 16;
- `allow_actions=false`: 16/16;
- eval infrastructure exists;
- durable certification remains incomplete until real AAL2-protected eval evidence is generated.

Never manufacture certification by inserting feedback/eval rows directly.

## Repository/governance continuity

The canonical product catalog remains 10 apps even though connected engineering inventory contains 9 repositories. Repository count, runtime count and provider-project count are not product counts.

Open legacy PRs must be interpreted against current evidence:

- PR #209: historical closure snapshot; superseded operationally by `PLATFORM_CLOSURE_2026-08-17.md` once the latter is merged.
- PR #215: historical ledger branch; superseded operationally by this file once merged.
- PR #213: isolated HOCKER Signal UI work; not a backend Core Integration Ready blocker, but remains a Full Launch/GA UI gate.

## Preserved perimeter target from historical closure work

Cloudflare target controls from PR #209 remain design evidence, not observed provider configuration:

`NOVA / AGIs -> Cloudflare Gateway -> HOCKER MCP Portal -> Access / identity -> HOCKER MCP policy + Owner Gate -> approved providers`

Network permission never replaces Hocker One MCP policy or Owner Gate. Provider evidence is required before claiming Cloudflare controls are active.

## Append-only milestones after the historical PR #215 cut

### 2026-08-16 / 2026-08-17 UTC — Recovery semantics stabilized

- PR #223 merged recovery semantics separating mutable pointers from frozen functional authority.
- PR #225 repaired the executable continuity regression that still required historical mutable pointers.

### Node liveness closure — PR #224 / #226

- RED established that commands/events must not prove node liveness.
- PR #224 moved Node Mirror liveness to `nodes.last_seen_at` and 5-minute freshness.
- Production schema verification then exposed that `public.nodes` uses primary key `id`, not `node_id`.
- PR #226 corrected the lookup under a new RED/GREEN cycle.
- Current physical node remains stale; the UI/runtime can no longer represent it as active merely from old status or command activity.

### AGI FK performance closure — PR #227

- Three genuine `unindexed_foreign_keys` findings were reproduced and classified.
- Rollback-only validation created all three indexes and left zero durable test DDL.
- Production migration registered as `20260817052915_agi_canonical_fk_indexes_20260817`.
- Git source was immediately aligned to remote version `20260817052915`.
- Performance Advisor no longer reports those three unindexed FKs.

### Supabase Advisor contract closure — PR #228

- Production inspection confirmed RLS enabled + policy coverage across all currently reported authenticated GraphQL table warnings.
- Public catalog/tier/promo reads and four SECURITY DEFINER RPC families were classified by actual contracts rather than silenced through broad revocation.
- `SUPABASE_ADVISOR_EXCEPTION_REGISTER_2026-08-17.md` made those boundaries explicit and testable.
- Leaked Password Protection remains an open provider gate.

### Railway evidence reconciliation

- GitHub deployment history confirmed Railway deployment was real and already implemented.
- Latest GitHub-linked production deployment record found for `nova.agi` is SHA `8be3cdc1891d740cc72d79e60d3aa35199b7efa2`.
- Its recorded state moved from `success` to **inactive**.
- No reimplementation or blind redeploy was performed.

## Handoff rule

At each material change, record separately:

1. current mutable pointers;
2. latest functional/security authority;
3. exact-head CI/CodeQL/deployment evidence;
4. provider/migration evidence;
5. blockers opened/closed;
6. whether the change affects Core Integration Ready, Full Launch/GA, or an optional degraded capability.

Never mark a gate green from narrative alone.
