# HOCKER Development Ledger

## Purpose
Durable continuity record for the HOCKER ecosystem. This ledger records only evidence observable from connected systems or canonical sources. `UNKNOWN` and `PENDING EVIDENCE` are intentional states, never assumptions.

## Audit scope and evidence limitations

Connected inventory on 2026-08-16 found **9 GitHub repositories** under `HockerAGI`: `hocker.one`, `hocker.agi`, `nova.agi`, `hocker-node-agent`, `chido.casino`, `chido.lab`, `chido.games`, `hocker.ads`, and `punto.g`.

Current connected provider inventory verifies **3 Vercel projects** in team `Hocker AGI`: `hocker-one`, `hocker.agi`, and `chido-casino`; and **2 Supabase projects** in the HOCKER organization: production/shared `Hocker AGI Technologies` (`yvuibbcuntqpyqiuqggd`, ACTIVE_HEALTHY, us-west-1, Postgres 17.6.1.063) plus `chido-hardening-validation-20260806` (`pswlloziztxjsjazfiiy`, ACTIVE_HEALTHY, us-west-1, Postgres 17.6.1.155). Provider state is directly observable for these surfaces. Conversation context remains secondary evidence.

## Ecosystem snapshot

| Repository | Visibility | Canonical/product role | Verified current state | Immediate gate / next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HockerAGI/hocker.one` | public | Hocker One control plane; governance of 16 AGIs | `main` includes guarded Owner+AAL2 runtime eval and read-only tool runtime through PR #208. Open PR #209 is the global evidence-based closure gate. Draft PR #214 is now at head `d1c2a9a9584c918d4b7b51f87c0d56b699c2e247`, mergeable, with GitHub Actions CI run `31968693820` = SUCCESS and exact Vercel Preview `dpl_E3bLLEom133WVQdgxbzUhi1Nzc18` = READY; it still has zero submitted reviews and explicitly states it does not authorize merge. Open PR #213 remains isolated HOCKER Signal UI work. PR #215 contains this ledger; prior exact head `b6d40bc52bec1eb75bafb1f4c6ce41ba747ca1c6` has GitHub Actions CI run `31959905737` = SUCCESS and Vercel Preview `dpl_3upykPjCVogPbCwQAdsqW1o1Dh77` = READY. PR #215 remains open, non-draft and mergeable; approved-review/branch-protection authorization remains `PENDING EVIDENCE`. Separate branch `work/p0-provider-independent-agi-memory-20260816` now also points to `d1c2a9a...` and its latest Vercel Preview `dpl_9xaGoaudG1xjA3wPUWYYgJ8AdvkS` = READY after multiple prior ERROR previews, but that branch itself still has no dedicated PR/review gate. | Do not claim platform closure. Resolve #209 blockers. Review #214 against #209 and Owner/AAL2 requirements; draft + zero reviews block promotion despite green CI/Preview. Keep #213 isolated. PR #215 remains unmerged because approval/branch-protection authorization is not evidenced. Treat the work branch recovery as build evidence only, not merge authorization. |
| `HockerAGI/hocker.agi` | public | corporate/public HOCKER surface | Active; open dependency PRs include TypeScript 7 (#15) and `@types/node` 26 (#12). Vercel project exists. | Dependency upgrades require compatibility/build/security evidence before merge. |
| `HockerAGI/nova.agi` | public | dedicated NOVA runtime | Open PR #32 establishes durable recovery/continuity; CI SUCCESS at recorded head. Dedicated live Railway revision, readiness, logs/heartbeat and authenticated Hocker One→NOVA E2E remain unverified in PR evidence. | Keep runtime deployment status fail-closed until exact live revision + readiness + logs + authenticated E2E are evidenced. |
| `HockerAGI/hocker-node-agent` | public | authorized local executor | Repository exists and is accessible. No fresh execution evidence was observed in the current cross-repo audit. | `PENDING EVIDENCE`: verify current main SHA, CI, allowlists, HMAC/non-root/sandbox posture and active-node evidence before asserting readiness. |
| `HockerAGI/chido.casino` | public | CHIDO Casino product | Launch Preview remains design/review only; real-money activation remains fail-closed. Vercel project exists. Shared production Supabase still contains gaming/wallet tables and functions that currently surface security-advisor WARNs. | Do not enable real money/KYC-public/regulated functionality. Resolve security-advisor findings and legal/Owner gates before any production expansion. |
| `HockerAGI/chido.lab` | private | CHIDO laboratory / upstream experimentation | Open PR #6 reconciles Lab→immutable Release Bundle→CHIDO Games ownership and explicitly preserves compatibility debt instead of deleting legacy contracts prematurely. | Keep Lab experimental; only promote immutable tested artifacts after consumer cutover and rollback evidence. |
| `HockerAGI/chido.games` | private | CHIDO Originals / B2B game runtime boundary | R3 migration is merged as DEMO/synthetic only. Open #9/#10 define Taco Heat Premium VS1 and VS1-A implementation planning; renderer, Casino integration and REAL remain out of scope. | Implement VS1-A by TDD without crossing DEMO/REAL or Casino production gates. |
| `HockerAGI/hocker.ads` | private | Hocker Ads | EXP-01 local data foundation and E-050 service/version catalog are merged. Open draft PR #18 implements E-060 order-draft/Checkout abstraction; exact-head Docs Contract, Web Core, Web Foundation and Local DB CI were all SUCCESS in the prior audit, but PR remains draft and its own scope forbids remote Supabase, Stripe, Vercel and customer traffic. | Review E-060 implementation/diff and remove draft only when semantic/security review passes. Remote provider gates remain independent; no merge solely because CI is green. |
| `HockerAGI/punto.g` | private | PUNTO·G separate platform | PRs #1/#2/#3 are merged. Main contains canonical specification, Phase 1 foundation/fail-closed policy and Phase 2 Auth/Identity/KYC foundation, including deterministic fake KYC provider and security audit records. | Next phase must preserve dedicated data/security boundaries; no real KYC/payment/production activation without provider and legal evidence. |

## Provider snapshot

### Vercel

- Team: `Hocker AGI` (`team_nEtACFYtjltFLERznYyZ40pK`).
- Projects: `hocker-one`, `hocker.agi`, `chido-casino`.
- Hocker One PR #214 exact head `d1c2a9a9584c918d4b7b51f87c0d56b699c2e247`: Preview `dpl_E3bLLEom133WVQdgxbzUhi1Nzc18` = `READY`; GitHub Actions CI run `31968693820` = `SUCCESS`.
- Hocker One PR #215 prior exact head `b6d40bc52bec1eb75bafb1f4c6ce41ba747ca1c6`: Preview `dpl_3upykPjCVogPbCwQAdsqW1o1Dh77` = `READY`; GitHub Actions CI run `31959905737` = `SUCCESS`.
- Branch `work/p0-provider-independent-agi-memory-20260816` recovered from repeated `ERROR` previews at latest head `d1c2a9a...`; latest Preview `dpl_9xaGoaudG1xjA3wPUWYYgJ8AdvkS` = `READY`. Recovery does not establish review/merge authorization.

### Supabase

Production/shared project `yvuibbcuntqpyqiuqggd` is `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`, but security posture is **not clean**:

- current branch metadata still reports `main` status `MIGRATIONS_FAILED` while preview project status is healthy;
- multiple RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO findings remain, including `agi_chat_messages`, `agi_integration_checks`, `agi_runtime_tokens`, Context Bridge tables, `game_history`, `owner_gate_approvals` and `wager_progress_ledger`;
- GraphQL exposure WARNs remain for anon/authenticated roles, including gaming, wallet, audit, nodes, KYC, LLM usage and other tables/views;
- SECURITY DEFINER RPC WARNs remain for public/authenticated execution, including public leaderboard/recent-wins and authenticated crash/slot history RPCs;
- leaked-password protection remains disabled (WARN).

Validation project `pswlloziztxjsjazfiiy` remains `ACTIVE_HEALTHY` but was previously verified as **not clean**:

- `public.validation_settlement_marker` had RLS disabled (`ERROR`);
- multiple SECURITY DEFINER wallet/wager functions were callable by `anon` and/or `authenticated` (`WARN`);
- several RLS-enabled/no-policy INFO findings remained.

These findings block any claim that Supabase security closure is complete. They do not by themselves prove exploitability, but they require explicit intent review, grants/RLS/RPC verification and remediation evidence before closure or regulated activation.

## Canonical product/AGI relationship

The canonical HOCKER portfolio remains 10 applications and 16 AGIs per the 2026.08 documentation. Repositories are implementation boundaries, not a one-to-one app count. `chido.lab`, `chido.games`, and `punto.g` require explicit classification in the global governance inventory because they extend beyond the earlier five-repository baseline. PUNTO·G is tracked here as a separately governed platform, not silently promoted into the canonical 10-app catalog.

## Cross-cutting findings

1. **Repository inventory drift is real:** connected GitHub exposes 9 repositories, while older canonical architecture/security documents recorded 5.
2. **Provider inventory drift is also real:** direct provider access verifies 3 Vercel projects and 2 Supabase projects; the second Supabase validation project is not represented in the prior ecosystem snapshot.
3. **Supabase closure remains blocked:** production/shared project retains security WARN/INFO findings and branch state `MIGRATIONS_FAILED`; validation project previously showed at least one security `ERROR` plus wallet/wager SECURITY DEFINER WARNs.
4. **Hocker One memory/runtime branch build regression recovered at current head:** branch `work/p0-provider-independent-agi-memory-20260816` moved from repeated Vercel Preview ERROR states to READY at `d1c2a9a...`. The same commit is the current head of draft PR #214, whose CI is also green, but no review/Owner authorization exists; recovery is not promotion evidence by itself.
5. **Hocker Ads E-060 progressed materially:** PR #18 exact-head CI was green across all four observed workflows, but it is still a draft and remains local/provider-neutral by contract.
6. **Ledger promotion gate remains technically green but not fully authorized:** PR #215 prior exact head `b6d40bc52bec1eb75bafb1f4c6ce41ba747ca1c6` has exact-head CI SUCCESS and Vercel Preview READY, but approved-review/branch-protection requirements remain `PENDING EVIDENCE`.
7. **Regulated/destructive surfaces remain fail-closed:** CHIDO real money, Wallet/financial actions, sensitive KYC, production DDL, secret rotation, AGI material actions and equivalent high-risk changes require the canonical human/Owner gates.

## Documentation drift queue

| Area | Drift | Required treatment | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global repository inventory | Canonical 2026.08 sources describe five repositories; connected inventory is nine. | Update editable DOC-00/DOC-05/DOC-07 inventory sources after classification of `chido.lab`, `chido.games`, `hocker.ads`, `punto.g`; regenerate derived PDFs only through the existing document pipeline. | PENDING OWNER CLASSIFICATION |
| Provider inventory | Prior snapshot omitted direct Vercel/Supabase provider state and second Supabase validation project. | Reconcile editable architecture/security inventory with 3 Vercel + 2 Supabase projects and explicit validation-project lifecycle/retirement policy. | OPEN DRIFT |
| Supabase security | DOC-07 describes earlier P0/P1 findings, but current advisor output contains a broader/new set including GraphQL exposure, SECURITY DEFINER execution, leaked-password protection and validation-project RLS ERROR. | Update editable security evidence/runbook source after owner/security review; remediate through migrations/configuration, then rerun advisors. | BLOCKED / ACTION REQUIRED |
| Hocker One continuity | PR #214 introduces continuity protocol, last-known-state and context reconciliation; exact head is now CI/Preview green after earlier branch-level preview failures. | Review against #209 closure gate and this global ledger; merge only after draft removal, required approvals and Owner/AAL2 gates. | OPEN DRAFT PR |
| NOVA continuity | PR #32 adds durable continuity but live Railway evidence is missing. | Preserve UNKNOWN live deployment status until exact runtime evidence exists. | OPEN PR |
| Hocker Ads | Repository has advanced into E-060 with exact-head CI green. | Reconcile APP-06 editable product/architecture sources after E-060 semantic review/stabilization; do not claim remote provider activation. | IN PROGRESS |
| CHIDO | Lab/Games split and R3 release-bundle architecture post-date older five-repo canon. | Reconcile architecture inventory and CHIDO product docs while preserving DEMO/REAL legal gates. | IN PROGRESS |
| PUNTO·G | Separately governed repo/platform not in canonical 10-app catalog. | Classify explicitly in governance docs without silently changing canonical app count. | PENDING OWNER/GOVERNANCE DECISION |

## Main/merge audit

**No automatic merge performed in this run.** Evidence-based reasons:

- Hocker One #209 retains global/provider/Owner blockers.
- Hocker One #214 is still draft, has zero submitted reviews and explicitly states it does not authorize merge, despite exact-head CI SUCCESS and Vercel READY.
- Hocker One #213 remains isolated UI/TDD work.
- Hocker One #215 prior exact head `b6d40bc52bec1eb75bafb1f4c6ce41ba747ca1c6` has CI SUCCESS and Vercel Preview READY, but approved-review/branch-protection authorization remains `PENDING EVIDENCE`; this ledger update creates a new exact head that must itself be gated.
- Hocker One provider-independent AGI/memory branch now has a READY latest preview but still lacks a dedicated PR/review authorization path; prior failures remain relevant regression history.
- NOVA #32 lacks exact live runtime/deployment/E2E evidence.
- Hocker Ads #18 is still draft; green CI does not substitute semantic/security review or its independent provider gates.
- CHIDO #9/#10 and Lab #6 are design/boundary work, not regulated-production authorizations.
- Current Supabase advisor findings and `MIGRATIONS_FAILED` branch state prevent a platform-security-closure claim.

## Required evidence for future reconciliation

For every material delta capture, when accessible: repository + SHA, PR, CI/checks, review state, deployment ID/status, migration identifier, Supabase advisor/RLS/grants evidence, runtime health/log window, security findings, documentation delta, Owner/AAL2 gate where required, and explicit next action.

## Append-only change history

### 2026-08-16 — Initial baseline

- Established ecosystem continuity ledger because no existing `HOCKER_DEVELOPMENT_LEDGER.md` was found across connected HOCKER repositories.
- Verified 9 accessible repositories under `HockerAGI`.
- Recorded current high-signal work: Hocker One closure/continuity/UI PRs; NOVA continuity PR; Hocker Ads EXP-01 E-010→E-050 progression; CHIDO Games R3 + VS1-A plan; PUNTO·G Phase 1/2 merges; CHIDO Casino Launch Preview planning.
- Identified canonical repository-count drift (5 documented vs 9 connected).
- Performed no production/provider mutation and no merge because complete promotion gates were not evidenced.

### 2026-08-16 04:07 PDT — Connected provider reconciliation

- Directly verified Vercel team and project inventory: 3 projects (`hocker-one`, `hocker.agi`, `chido-casino`).
- Directly verified Supabase inventory: production/shared HOCKER project plus `chido-hardening-validation-20260806` validation project.
- Verified Hocker One Ledger PR #215 exact-head GitHub CI SUCCESS and Vercel Preview READY.
- Detected repeated Vercel Preview ERROR deployments on unreviewed branch `work/p0-provider-independent-agi-memory-20260816`; no PR exists for that branch.
- Verified Hocker Ads E-060 draft PR #18 exact-head CI SUCCESS across Docs Contract, Web Core, Web Foundation and Local DB workflows; kept it unmerged because draft/review/provider gates remain.
- Reran Supabase security advisors. Production/shared project retains multiple WARN/INFO findings and branch state `MIGRATIONS_FAILED`; validation project has an RLS-disabled `ERROR` and multiple SECURITY DEFINER execution WARNs.
- Performed no production DDL, secret/config mutation or main merge. Updated only this governance ledger branch with evidence.

### 2026-08-16 05:07 PDT — Exact-head promotion gate verification

- Verified PR #215 head `dca5ea97cef7ba85a1f92d6bb7d04d1c0993e95f` had GitHub Actions CI run `31943561663` completed with `success`.
- Verified the same exact head had Vercel Preview `dpl_JC7D2mmqJ4qiiYFUifsyRvEVeNTq` in `READY` state.
- Verified PR #215 remained open, non-draft and mergeable, but had no submitted reviews.
- Attempted to read `main` branch-protection requirements; GitHub integration returned `403 Resource not accessible by integration`, so required-review/check policy remains `PENDING EVIDENCE` rather than assumed.
- Rechecked production/shared Supabase branch state: `main` remained `MIGRATIONS_FAILED`; security advisor findings remained materially unchanged, including GraphQL exposure, SECURITY DEFINER execution and leaked-password-protection WARNs.
- Performed no main merge, production DDL or configuration mutation because the full promotion/security gates were still not evidenced.

### 2026-08-16 06:06 PDT — Ledger head advanced and exact-head evidence reconfirmed

- PR #215 head advanced to `b1921fbed9a1c226c151dc25b6f453b67f90f25e`.

- Verified exact-head Vercel Preview `dpl_6JEyRn2qdBa9v2QHJmRoSmhgmUST` is `READY`.
- Verified PR #215 remains open, non-draft and mergeable with zero submitted reviews; branch-protection requirements remain `PENDING EVIDENCE`.
- Rechecked production/shared Supabase: branch `main` remains `MIGRATIONS_FAILED` and security advisor findings remain materially unchanged.
- Performed no merge, production DDL, secrets/configuration change, regulated activation or other high-risk mutation.

### 2026-08-16 06:55 PDT — Current ledger exact-head green; authorization gate unchanged

- Verified PR #215 head `0c4ba7c5d11e46b1c95c8af3dffe399581fd602b` had GitHub Actions CI run `31948995696` completed with `success`.
- Verified the same exact head had Vercel Preview `dpl_6KDJcteoLnYj9HGVS6Z1HAty1yqN` in `READY` state.
- Verified PR #215 remains open, non-draft and mergeable with zero submitted reviews.
- Rechecked production/shared Supabase: project remains `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`, branch `main` remains `MIGRATIONS_FAILED`, and security-advisor findings remain materially unchanged, including RLS-no-policy INFO, GraphQL exposure WARNs, SECURITY DEFINER execution WARNs, and leaked-password-protection disabled.
- Performed no main merge, production DDL, secret/configuration mutation, regulated activation or other high-risk action because authorization/branch-protection evidence remains incomplete.

### 2026-08-16 08:04 PDT — Exact-head gate closed technically; authorization still pending

- Verified PR #215 exact head `7ec606515f7a0e04c113bca988306f7eb9a40318` has GitHub Actions CI run `31951311957` completed with `success`.

- No new open PR activity was returned for the organization in the monitored interval.
- Performed no main merge, production DDL, secret/configuration mutation, regulated activation or other high-risk action because review/authorization and platform-security gates remain incomplete.

### 2026-08-16 09:05 PDT — b195 exact-head green; authorization unchanged

- Verified PR #215 exact head `b195fc5e08b0c59ae6b609f3e9be92a56ea46b54` has GitHub Actions CI run `31954677883` completed with `success`.

- Rechecked provider inventory: still 3 Vercel projects and 2 Supabase projects; no expansion detected.
- Rechecked production/shared Supabase: project remains `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`, branch `main` remains `MIGRATIONS_FAILED`; current advisors still report RLS-no-policy INFO, anon/authenticated GraphQL exposure WARNs, SECURITY DEFINER execution WARNs and leaked-password-protection disabled.
- Cross-repo commit scan found no newer product/runtime commits than the already-recorded CHIDO Games/Hocker Ads work; no new promotable implementation was evidenced in this interval.
- Performed no main merge, production DDL, secret/configuration mutation, regulated activation or other high-risk action because review/authorization and platform-security gates remain incomplete.

### 2026-08-16 12:54 PDT — Hocker One PR #214 exact-head recovered to green

- Verified draft PR #214 current head `d1c2a9a9584c918d4b7b51f87c0d56b699c2e247` is open and mergeable but remains draft with zero submitted reviews.
- Verified exact-head GitHub Actions CI run `31968693820` completed with `success`.
- Verified exact-head Vercel Preview `dpl_E3bLLEom133WVQdgxbzUhi1Nzc18` is `READY`.
- Verified the parallel branch `work/p0-provider-independent-agi-memory-20260816` also has a latest READY Preview `dpl_9xaGoaudG1xjA3wPUWYYgJ8AdvkS` for the same commit after multiple prior ERROR previews; this closes the observed build regression at current head but not the review/authorization gate.
- Verified PR #215 prior head `b6d40bc52bec1eb75bafb1f4c6ce41ba747ca1c6` has GitHub Actions CI run `31959905737` = `success` and Vercel Preview `dpl_3upykPjCVogPbCwQAdsqW1o1Dh77` = `READY`; PR #215 remains open/non-draft/mergeable but approval and readable branch-protection authorization remain `PENDING EVIDENCE`.
- Rechecked provider inventory: still 3 Vercel projects and 2 Supabase projects; production/shared Supabase `main` remains `MIGRATIONS_FAILED`, and current security advisors remain materially unchanged (RLS-no-policy INFO, GraphQL exposure WARNs, SECURITY DEFINER execution WARNs, leaked-password-protection disabled).
- Performed no main merge, production DDL, grant/RLS mutation, secret/configuration change, regulated activation or Owner-gated action.
